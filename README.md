-AC Vent: two-dimensional, playing on loop at all times
-Wand draw: plays while the trigger is in drawing mode
    * accomplished by holding the trigger down while holding the wand
-Spell cast: plays after a circle is successfully drawn with the wand 
    * accomplished by drawing a circle shape while in drawing mode, then releasing the trigger
-Wand tap: plays when the wand touches a crystal ball (no limit on it at the moment since rapid sound effects triggering is kind of funny)
-Goblin: loops on goblins that are spawned by casting a spell and touching a crystal ball
-Teleport: plays when the player picks up a crystal ball and holds down the trigger
